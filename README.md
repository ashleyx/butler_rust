Rust rewrite of [butler.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashleyx/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/butler/butler.py) from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ashleyx/dotfiles) 

I use this to manage my laptop power profile, keyboard lighting, video wallpaper and the anime-matrix display(asus g14) based on whether its plugged in and if its a trusted wifi connection. 
If you think you have an use case that's sensible, i'll do it. 

Will officially support linux(wayland/archlinux,?) and MacOS. 

If you want me to support your stack, add and issue detailing the tech stack.
